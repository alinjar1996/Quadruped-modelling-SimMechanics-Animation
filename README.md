# Quadruped-modelling-SimMechanics-Animation
This repository contains animation for simulation of a quadruped under external disturbance.  The Quadruped is modelled in Matlab-SimMechanics. The control methodology that ensures stable movement of the quadruped is novel and currently under preparation for a manuscript.
